#Description:
#Your program must prompt the user for their city or zip code and request weather forecast data from openweathermap.org.  
#Your program must display the weather information in an READABLE format to the user.

#Requirements: 
#	Create a Python Application which asks the user for their zip code or city.

#	Use the zip code or city name in order to obtain weather forecast data from: http://openweathermap.org/

#	Display the weather forecast in a readable format to the user.

#	Use comments within the application where appropriate in order to document what the program is doing.

#	Use functions including a main function.
	
#	Allow the user to run the program multiple times.
	
#	Validate whether the user entered valid data. If valid data isn’t presented notify the user.
	
#	Use the Requests library in order to request data from the webservice.
	
#	Use Python 3.
	
#	Use try blocks when establishing connections to the webservice. 

#	You must print a message to the user indicating whether or not the connection was successful.

#Request Data
#These were the two parts that were the hardest for me. My draft had variations of this that didn't work.
